# Instructions

1. Create a `DatePicker` component that renders a button to open/close a calendar.
   - This component should be a controlled component which means that it should accept an `onChange` and `value` prop (similar to an `input` element).
   - This component should default to the current date when the page loads.
   - When the calendar is opened it should open to the month of the selected date.

The only other thing to note about this project is that it is built using `date-fns`. You can use any date library you want (even the built in JS Date API), but I will be using `date-fns` in my walkthrough video as I find it to be one of the best date libraries available.
